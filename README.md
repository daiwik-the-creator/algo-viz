## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **3D WebGL 2.0-based visualizer** for machine learning clustering algorithms — **K-Means** and **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**. It is designed to help students, developers, and enthusiasts intuitively understand how these algorithms function in 3D space.

Using interactive 3D visualization, users can explore clustering dynamics, observe how centroids shift (in K-Means), or how clusters form based on density (in DBSCAN), and gain a deeper understanding of spatial clustering behavior.

## ✅ Features

- Fully interactive **3D visualization** rendered using **WebGL 2.0**
- Two algorithms supported: **K-Means** and **DBSCAN**
- **Orbit camera** system with rotation and zoom
- **Textured spheres** to represent data points and centroids
- **Blinn-Phong lighting model** for realistic shading
- Upload your own dataset (`.csv` files)
- Toggle **lighting** and **textures**
- Built-in datasets like `swiss roll` and `noise`
- **Reset button** to revert the app to its initial state

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- A modern browser that supports **WebGL 2.0** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- No installation required — the app runs entirely in the browser
